        text:"Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the solar system, with a diameter of about 139,820 kilometers. It is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with a thick atmosphere featuring powerful storms, including the famous Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has lasted for centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and at least 79 known moons. Its moons vary widely in size and characteristics, with four large moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—collectively known as the Galilean moons, discovered by Galileo in 1610.",
