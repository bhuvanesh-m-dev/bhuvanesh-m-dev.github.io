    text: "A PLANET is a celestial body that orbits a star, such as the Sun, and possesses enough mass to maintain a nearly spherical shape due to its own gravity. Unlike stars, planets do not produce their own light but reflect the light of their star. In our solar system, planets are divided into terrestrial planets, like Earth and Mars, which have solid, rocky surfaces, and gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn, which are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. To be classified as a planet, a celestial body must meet specific criteria set by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It must orbit a star, have sufficient mass to form a nearly round shape, and have cleared its orbital path of other debris. These characteristics distinguish planets from other celestial objects such as asteroids and dwarf planets, the latter of which do not meet all the criteria, like Pluto, which shares its orbit with other objects in the Kuiper Belt.",
