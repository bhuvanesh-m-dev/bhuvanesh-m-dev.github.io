        text: "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen, which makes it unable to retain heat, causing extreme temperature fluctuations. Mercury’s surface is heavily cratered, similar to the Moon, due to a lack of an atmosphere to protect it from impacts. A year on Mercury, or one full orbit around the Sun, lasts just 88 Earth days, while a day on Mercury (one full rotation) is about 59 Earth days. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has no moons, and its surface experiences temperatures ranging from extremely hot (up to 430°C) during the day to freezing cold (-180°C) at night.",

        text: "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet' due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers and is home to the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a massive canyon, Valles Marineris. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon, and experiences extreme temperatures ranging from -125°C to 20°C. It has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and evidence suggests that liquid water once existed on its surface in the distant past. Mars is a prime target for exploration, with missions seeking to determine its potential for past or present life.",

With a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers, Earth's surface is 71% water and 29% land, which includes continents and islands. Its atmosphere, composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, protects life and regulates the planet's temperature. Earth orbits the Sun in approximately 365.25 days, and it has one natural satellite, the Moon, which influences tides and stabilizes the planet's axial tilt. The combination of water, a breathable atmosphere, and suitable conditions for life makes Earth unique in the solar system.",

Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and at least 79 known moons. Its moons vary widely in size and characteristics, with four large moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—collectively known as the Galilean moons, discovered by Galileo in 1610.",

It is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter, and is best known for its stunning system of rings made up of ice particles, rock debris, and dust. Saturn's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen, with helium and traces of other gases, and features strong winds, storms, and a hexagonal cloud pattern at its north pole. The planet has over 80 known moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system, which is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere, possibly containing liquid methane lakes. Saturn's low density means it could float in water, as it is mostly made of lighter elements like hydrogen and helium. The planet's beauty, along with its many moons and complex ring system, makes it one of the most studied planets in the solar system.",

It is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and methane, the latter of which gives the planet its characteristic blue color. Neptune has a very active atmosphere, with strong winds, storms, and the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour. The planet has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most notable. Triton is unique because it has a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation, and is believed to have been captured by Neptune’s gravity. Neptune is also known for its Great Dark Spot, a storm similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, though it has since disappeared. Despite its distance from the Sun, Neptune's intense internal heat drives much of its weather systems.",

It is an ice giant composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and ices such as water, ammonia, and methane, which gives it a pale blue color. Uranus is unique among the planets because it has an extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, meaning it essentially orbits the Sun on its side, with its poles facing directly toward the Sun at different points in its orbit. This unusual tilt leads to extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous daylight followed by 42 years of darkness. Uranus has a faint ring system and 27 known moons, with Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon being the largest. The planet's atmosphere features strong winds and large storm systems, and its cold interior generates more heat than it receives from the Sun. Uranus remains one of the least explored planets, with only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, having visited it during a flyby in 1986.",

    text: "A PLANET is a celestial body that orbits a star, such as the Sun, and possesses enough mass to maintain a nearly spherical shape due to its own gravity. Unlike stars, planets do not produce their own light but reflect the light of their star. In our solar system, planets are divided into terrestrial planets, like Earth and Mars, which have solid, rocky surfaces, and gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn, which are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. To be classified as a planet, a celestial body must meet specific criteria set by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It must orbit a star, have sufficient mass to form a nearly round shape, and have cleared its orbital path of other debris. These characteristics distinguish planets from other celestial objects such as asteroids and dwarf planets, the latter of which do not meet all the criteria, like Pluto, which shares its orbit with other objects in the Kuiper Belt.",
